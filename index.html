The Postal Service plans to release the stamp for purchase here in Atlanta on October 1, which would have been former President Carter’s 101st birthday.
He died Dec. 29, 2024, at the age of 100.
“The stamp program celebrates the best in American culture, places and people, and it is difficult to consider a more fitting honoree than former President Jimmy Carter,” said Peter Pastre, the Postal Service’s government relations and public policy vice president. “In his support and leadership of his beloved community, state and nation, he lent his quiet, thoughtful and deliberate energy around causes he believed in, and most certainly in his conduct and accomplishments as a former president.
“Jimmy Carter truly personified the best in America. I am honored to participate in the reveal of this stamp art which fully evokes his humanity.”
The stamp art is a 1982 oil-on-linen painting created in preparation for President Carter’s official White House portrait.
“The Carter family and the Friends of Jimmy Carter are honored to be able to take part in revealing the design for President Carter’s Forever stamp,” Kim Carter Fuller, executive director of the Friends of Jimmy Carter, said. “Together we’ve had the distinct privilege of a front row seat to his life and legacy, and today’s reveal gives the world an opportunity to share his legacy with others on a daily basis.”`,

This date would have marked Carter's 101st birthday. The former president passed away on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100.
The design for the commemorative stamp was unveiled today at the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park in Plains, Georgia. Kim Carter Fuller, executive director of the Friends of Jimmy Carter, stated, "The Carter family and the Friends of Jimmy Carter are honored to be able to take part in revealing the design for President Carter’s Forever stamp." She added, "Today’s reveal gives the world an opportunity to share his legacy with others on a daily basis."
The stamp serves as a lasting tribute to the beloved Georgia native and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Atlanta residents and stamp collectors can anticipate acquiring this piece of history this fall.`,

Authorities are urging residents in these areas with home security cameras to review their footage and share any suspicious activity. The department stated, "Together, we can keep Stockbridge safe. Thank you for your vigilance and partnership."
Police remind citizens to "Hide, Lock, Take" to prevent future incidents: hide valuables, lock doors, and take keys. Anyone with information is asked to call 770-957-9121 for non-emergencies.`,

"The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles is proud to announce a new option aimed at enhancing public safety and communication," stated the OMV in a recent Facebook post. This indicator allows those diagnosed by a medical professional to have their condition noted on their identification.
The new feature is available on all license classes and ID cards, can be combined with Autism or Needs Accommodation indicators, and comes with no fee to add or remove. It can also be removed at any time without additional documentation. This initiative underscores the OMV's commitment "to support and protect individuals with medical needs in Louisiana."`,
      textBlock2: `Louisiana residents diagnosed with a seizure disorder can now choose to have a seizure indicator added to their driver’s license or identification card, according to the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles.
The indicator is designed to promote health awareness and provide important information to law enforcement and first responders during emergencies. It is optional and available for any class of license or ID except handicap and voter ID cards.
The seizure designation can be combined with the Needs Accommodation and Autism indicators, and may be removed at any time at the applicant’s request.
How to Apply: Applicants must submit a Medical Examiner’s Certification of Seizure Disorder form completed by a licensed medical or mental health professional authorized in Louisiana or any U.S. state or territory.
If the certifying professional indicates the applicant has not been seizure-free for six months, the OMV will require an additional neurological medical report from the applicant’s treating physician.
Louisiana law requires individuals to be seizure-free for at least six months to maintain valid driving privileges.`,
